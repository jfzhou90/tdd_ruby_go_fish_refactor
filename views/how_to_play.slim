      Each player starts with either 5 or 7 cards thatcan only be seen
      by that player.
      Each set in the player’s hand will be removed and counted as a point.
      Players take turns to ask one of their opponents for a card that
      can form a set.

      If the opponent does not have the card, the player must “Go Fish”
      and pick a card from the deck.

      The game ends when one player’s hand of cards becomes empty.
      The winner is the player with the most pairs.
